title: Modern Chinese Girl
---

In Chinese traditional culture, girls should be shy and passive.

But my experience has told me, it's not true.

In ancient China, there was a talented girl - "Zhuo Wen Jun" who lead her MR.Right to elope just like a warrior!

I guess there's lot of Zhuo Wen Jun 's descendants in China nowadays.

Facts have proven that I am right because there's a girl that asked me out a few days ago.

I didn't feel any chemistry with her. Well, this is not the point -_-

The point is she is a real warrior!

The modern Chinese girl is not only gentle, but also brave and strong.

If I fall in love with someone someday, maybe she is Zhuo Wen Jun 's descendant too :)
