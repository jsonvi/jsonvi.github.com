title: Building a filesystem based wiki
---

## What

The idea of building a filesystem-based wiki was inspired by [AndyGlew](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki/?FilesystemBasedWiki)

### The main feature about filesystem-based wiki:
 - No Web server
 - No Database
 - Cross-platform
 - Portable
 - Raw pages stored as individual text files
 - Simple wiki markup

## Why

### Lightweight

 - For personal use, database+webserver solution is too heavy.
 - It's portable,cross-platform , it can live in a USB flash drive.

### Extensibility

#### Third-party tools that work for text file will work for filesystem-based wiki too,such as:
 - Version Control tools like svn,cvs,git, way for collaboration.
 - Converter Tools/Scripts,raw pages will be able to publish as html pages.
 - Imaginative play, extensibility will be infinite
